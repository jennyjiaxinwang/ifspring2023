                How am I supposed to tell you

                I don't wanna see you with anyone but me?
                <br>
                Nobody gets me like you

                How am I supposed to let you go?
                <br>
                Only like myself when I'm with you

                Took me out to the ballet
                <br>
                You proposed, I went on the road
                <br>
                You was feelin' empty so you left me
                <br>
                Now I'm stuck dealin' with a deadbeat
                <br>

                If I'm real, I deserve less
                <br>
                If I was you, I wouldn't take me back
                <br>
                I pretend when I'm with a man it's you
