        <h1>Hello World!</h1> 
        
        <ol>
            <li>Jenny, Communication Design, Senior</li>
            <li>I'm a ComDes major with a minor in Speech and Hearing Sciences. I'm mostly taking this class because it is a major requirement but I'm also interested in UI/UX design. I pretty much have no computer science or coding experience so this is all super new and a little scary to me.</li>
            <li>Yeah, like I said before I have pretty much no experience in any sort of coding.</li>
            <li>I hope that this class allows me to get a small bit of perspective. To see some of the backend of UI/UX design.</li>
            <li>Designing for the screen tends to fluctuate more than designing analog. But at the same time the iterative process is not as taxing.</li>
            <li>https://www.baggu.com/ because I think they not only have unique products but they have a fun way of marketing them as well. They really use the bag designs/illustrations to their advantage. Additionally, it doesn't feel too overwhelming because the navigation is kept simple.</li>
            <li>https://fontsinuse.com/ because it does exactly what it claims to do. It shows you different fonts and instances in which they've been used while providing you with information about the fonts and other typefaces that may be used in conjunction in the specific example. The site is incredibly easy to navigate with just three tabs and everything else is grid formation.</li>
            <li>https://www.hi-qwerty.com/services I think this site works well because it's super clean, straighforward, and the dot cursor allows for easy visual navigation. There are no distracting colors or images, but there are a couple of types of moving text that make it intersting to look at and allow for a different reading experience than just static text.</li>
        </ol>
